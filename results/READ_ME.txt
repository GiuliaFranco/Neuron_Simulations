Every result file of the form Latency_i.txt is composed by 4 columns, readable as follows:

Latency[ms] current time[sec] spike time[sec] spike amplitude [mV]

For i in 1,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50 Hz.

- WBSG :  WB + slow sodium inactivation + guler stochasticity 

Current applied is an electrical squared train impulse with aplitude 7.96 uA and duration of the single squared pulse 0.26000 ms.
Total stimulation time: 3600000 ms (1 Hour).
Simulations use all the same integration step of 0.01 ms.
